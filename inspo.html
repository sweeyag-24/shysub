<h1><strong>My Inspiration-Ratan Tata</strong></h1>
<p>Ratan Tata is a huge inspiration of mine. He has done a lot for the country by playing the roles of an Industrialist and a philantrophist. His work for the Tata group of institutions by being it's chairperson has brought a tremondous improvement for the company and it's customers.
<span>But for me,</span>
<span>his work towards the welfare of the stray dogs</span>
<span>or his<em>fluffy friends</em>as he likes to call them has to be the most notable one upto date.<span>
<span>His fame was bought by him because of two main reasons</span>
<div>His work as an innovative businessman</div>
<div>and</div>
<div>his work as a tireless philantrophist</div>
<p>He was born on 28<sup>th</sup>December in Mumbai,or then Bombay.He was born into the very famous Indian Tata family. He had his education at the Cornell University. And he returned to India,and took up charge for the Tata company.
